# Biography

Alana is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Sociology at the
University of California, Davis. Her research uses an
intersectional, feminist approach to study inequalities in the food
system. She engages in public scholarship, as she researches
stratification, intersectionality, food studies, and organizations.
In this research, she pulls on the methods of ethnography,
interviews, and network analysis.

Her current public scholarship work focuses on how intersectional identities, such as
gender, race, and housing status can affect the barriers people
face as they try to access food assistance. She is also working on
projects that examine the embeddedness of food banks in local food
systems and the prominence of neoliberalism in the discourse
surrounding solving world hunger.
