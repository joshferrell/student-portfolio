The World Expo Milano 2015 “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life” was
the first World Expo to be themed around food. The central theme of
the Expo questioned how the world can feed everyone in a sustainable
manner. This research project was a case study of the World Expo that
examined the central themes that different entities expressed as
solutions to creating food security. The pavilions of different
entities, such as countries, groups of countries, civil society
organizations, corporations, and international organizations, were
evaluated through participant observation.\

Pavilion Zero, the pavilion sponsored by the Expo that was designed to represent
the theme of “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life”, was used as a baseline to which
the other pavilions could be compared. The central, emergent themes of
reducing economic inequality, promoting environmental sustainability,
and fostering women’s empowerment were examined in depth. The extent
of coverage and the sub-themes of each of these themes were then
analyzed in comparison to the type of entity that sponsored the pavilion.
These themes and sub themes were also compared to the findings in the
literature review.\

The study found that environmental sustainability
was the most prominent theme in the Expo, particularly in the pavilions
of corporations and most developed countries; it was more prominent in
the Expo than in the literature findings. Women’s empowerment was least
talked about within the Expo despite its importance in the literature;
when the issue was discussed, it was showcased by civil society
organizations/international organizations and countries that do not have
most developed economies. This study found that the proposed solutions to
solving world hunger and food insecurity varied according to the type of
entity that sponsored the pavilion.
